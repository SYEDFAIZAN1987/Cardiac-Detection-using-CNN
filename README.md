# Cardiac-Detection-using-CNN
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on ResNet-18 to detect cardiac abnormalities in medical imaging data. The model was trained and evaluated on a cardiac dataset, achieving high accuracy and robust performance in identifying critical cardiac features. Bounding box regression was used for localization.
